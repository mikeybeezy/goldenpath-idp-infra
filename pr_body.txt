##  Inline Terraform Plan

<details><summary> <strong>Targeted Terraform Plan</strong></summary>

This plan was generated using a **bounded context** strategy (`-target`), focusing only on the new ECR repository.
Note: state refresh was skipped because this is a shallow plan.

```hcl


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.ecr_repositories["backstage-regza"].aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy.this will be created
  + resource "aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy" "this" {
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + policy      = jsonencode(
            {
              + rules = [
                  + {
                      + action       = {
                          + type = "expire"
                        }
                      + description  = "Keep last 30 images (medium risk policy)"
                      + rulePriority = 1
                      + selection    = {
                          + countNumber = 30
                          + countType   = "imageCountMoreThan"

                        }
                    },
                ]
            }
        )

    }

          + "goldenpath.idp/owner" = "platform-team"
          + "goldenpath.idp/risk"  = "medium"
        }
      + tags_all             = {
          + "goldenpath.idp/id"    = "REGISTRY_BACKSTAGE_REGZA"
          + "goldenpath.idp/owner" = "platform-team"
          + "goldenpath.idp/risk"  = "medium"
        }

      + encryption_configuration {
          + encryption_type = "AES256"

        }

      + image_scanning_configuration {
          + scan_on_push = true
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Warning: Resource targeting is in effect

You are creating a plan with the -target option, which means that the result
of this plan may not represent all of the changes requested by the current
configuration.

The -target option is not for routine use, and is provided only for
exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes, or when
Terraform specifically suggests to use it as part of an error message.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```
