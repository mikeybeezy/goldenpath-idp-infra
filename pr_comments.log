Notes after conflict resolution:

- `ci-docs.yml`: consider pinning `pyyaml` (or a small requirements file) for reproducible metadata validation, and optionally set `permissions: contents: read` for least-privilege.

I’ve resolved the merge conflicts with `development` and pushed the fix; CI should re-run on the updated branch.
