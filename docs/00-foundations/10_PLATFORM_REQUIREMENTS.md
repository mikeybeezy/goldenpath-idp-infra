## Platform Requirements

This document defines the minimum functional and non-functional requirements for
the Golden Path IDP platform and clarifies the platform’s scope for V1.

## Purpose

- Establish a clear baseline for what the platform must provide.
- Align delivery and governance expectations across teams.
- Provide verifiable acceptance criteria for readiness.

## Scope

Applies to platform tooling, delivery rails, governance, and operational
standards across dev, staging, and prod environments.

## Non-goals (V1)

- Multi-cloud support or alternate cloud providers.
- Full distributed tracing and SLO automation.
- Vault-based secrets or dynamic secret rotation.
- Arbitrary CI/CD engines outside defined contracts.

## Governance Alignment (Summary)

Requirements are derived from platform governance principles:

- Opinionated by default (Golden Path first).
- Contracts over customization (stable interfaces).
- Preventative governance via automation and guardrails.
- Tagging and changelog accountability as mandatory controls.

See `docs/10-governance/01_GOVERNANCE.md` for the authoritative policy context.

## Functional Requirements

- **Identity & Access**
  - Centralized SSO for platform tooling.
  - Environment-scoped RBAC and least-privilege roles.
- **Golden Path Provisioning (V1 Core)**
  - Backstage-accessible templates for:
    - Stateless apps
    - Stateful apps (PVC-backed)
    - S3 buckets
    - RDS databases
    - ECR repositories
    - EC2 instances (platform approval required)
    - EKS clusters (platform approval required)
  - GitHub repository creation via scaffolder templates.
  - Requests are confirmed via PRs/merge requests before apply.
- **Approval & Privilege Model**
  - Elevated GitHub Actions workflows are restricted to platform team.
  - Elevated CLI/Make actions are restricted to platform team.
- **GitOps Delivery**
  - ArgoCD is the source of truth for cluster workloads.
  - Promotion gates enforced per environment.
  - Post-apply health checks required for success.
- **Service Catalog**
  - Backstage catalog with ownership, lifecycle, and docs links.
  - Approved templates exposed via the catalog.
- **Secrets Management**
  - External Secrets Operator (ESO) backed by AWS Secrets Manager.
  - Secrets never committed to Git.
- **Observability**
  - Prometheus + Grafana baseline with Golden Signals dashboards.
  - Loki for log aggregation.
- **Ingress & DNS**
  - Kong ingress with TLS.
  - Tooling exposed via `*.goldenpathidp.io`.
- **Governance & Compliance**
  - ADR and changelog coverage per scope.
  - Metadata validation and sidecar injection pass repo-wide.
  - Governance registry branch used for derived artifacts.
- **Lifecycle & Recovery**
  - Deterministic teardown with orphan cleanup.
  - Runbooks for common recovery paths.

## Access Model (V1)

|Action|Non-platform teams|Platform team|
|---|---|---|
|Create request via Backstage|✅|✅|
|Merge PR for infra/app provisioning|🚫|✅|
|Run elevated GitHub Actions (manual dropdown)|🚫|✅|
|Run privileged CLI/Make actions|🚫|✅|

## Golden Path Flow (V1)

- Backstage template → PR created → platform approval → ArgoCD sync.
- Non-platform teams request; platform team approves and executes elevated actions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**
  - Rollback via Git revert is supported for platform changes.
  - Teardown paths are CI-safe and auditable.
- **Security**
  - TLS for all tooling endpoints.
  - Least-privilege IAM and tag-scoped delete policies.
- **Operability**
  - Runbooks exist for core failure modes.
  - Break-glass steps are documented and reversible.
- **Performance**
  - Baseline performance targets defined in the Platform Service Agreement.
- **Auditability**
  - All material changes are captured in ADRs and changelogs.
  - Governance reports are reproducible from source SHA.

## Environments & Promotion

- **Dev**: fast iteration, default testing ground.
- **Staging**: pre-prod parity and validation gate.
- **Prod**: stable access with controlled change windows.
- Promotion flows from dev → staging → prod with explicit approval gates.

## Acceptance Criteria (V1)

- Backstage, Keycloak, ArgoCD, and Grafana reachable via `*.goldenpathidp.io`.
- Backstage catalog loads from the governance-registry branch.
- `scripts/validate_metadata.py` passes repo-wide.
- Required runbooks exist for deployment, teardown, and access recovery.
- Platform health report and indices are generated by CI.
- Golden Path templates listed in Backstage for non-platform teams.
- PR approval is required before privileged apply workflows run.
- Stateless app provisioning completes within 1 business day (request → merge).
