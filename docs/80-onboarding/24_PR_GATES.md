# PR Gates and How to Unblock Them

Doc contract:

- Purpose: Explain PR gates, triggers, and the fastest way to unblock.
- Owner: platform
- Status: living
- Review cadence: 90d
- Related: docs/10-governance/04_PR_GUARDRAILS.md, docs/90-doc-system/30_DOCUMENTATION_FRESHNESS.md

This is a contributor-facing guide to PR gates. It aims to prevent confusion
by showing what triggers each gate and the expected response. Open to refinement
and contribution.

> **Pro-Tip**: Use the [**Frictionless PR Workflow (RB-0027)**](../70-operations/runbooks/RB-0027-frictionless-pr-gates.md) to pass all checks automatically.

## Gate flow (approximate)

                                     [Quality Checks] (Enforced)
                                       - Doc freshness (index check)
                                       - Metadata validation
```

## Runbook: PR to green (deterministic)

1. Sync base branch and confirm target (`feature -> development`, `development -> main`).
2. Identify required gates from change scope (labels, ADR, changelog, doc freshness).
3. Prepare PR content: short summary, checklist selections, testing notes/links.
4. Add required artifacts (ADR, changelog, doc index updates).
5. Run local guardrails (`bin/governance lint`, `bin/governance audit`).
6. Commit, push, and open PR using `.github/pull_request_template.md` (CLI:
   `gh pr create -F .github/pull_request_template.md`) with checklist completed.
7. Check CI/guardrail results immediately; if any fail, follow the triage loop
   below.
8. Re-run local guardrails (`bin/governance lint`) after fixes and re-push until all checks pass.
9. If checks appear stuck or a retarget is not picked up, add a no-op commit to retrigger.
10. Confirm all required checks are green and approvals are in place.
11. If opening a second PR (for example, `development -> main`), repeat steps 2-10.
12. If GitHub reports merge conflicts, rebase on the base branch and repeat steps 5-10.

## Failure triage loop (repeat until green)

```text
[Check failed] -> read logs -> map to file/rule -> fix -> re-run local checks
     -> push -> re-check CI
```

## When to use a no-op commit

Use a no-op commit only when the PR content has not changed but you need to
force a re-run of checks. Typical cases:

- Retargeted base branch (checks still show the previous branch policy result).
- Workflow or policy checks stuck in "queued" or "in progress".
- GitHub reports a stale or missing check after a force-push or rebase.

Example:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: retrigger PR checks"
git push
```

## Common failures and fast fixes

| Failure | Likely cause | Fast fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trim trailing whitespace` | Extra spaces at line ends | Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and commit changes |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | Missing newline at EOF | Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and commit changes |
| `Missing changelog entry` | `changelog-required` label | Add `docs/changelog/entries/CL-####-short-title.md` |
| `Missing ADR entry` | `adr-required` label | Add `docs/adrs/ADR-####-short-title.md` and update index |
| `Branch Policy Guard` | PR targets `main` from non-`development` | Open PR into `development` |
| `Labeler` | Invalid `.github/labeler.yml` or stale base | Fix config or update base branch |
| Merge conflicts | Base branch moved since branch creation | Rebase on base and resolve conflicts |
| `TDD Gate: Missing tests` | New `.py`/`.sh` without test file | Add `test_*.py` or `test_*.bats` file |
| `Blast Radius Exceeded` | PR changes >80 files | Add `blast-radius-approved` label or split PR |
| `pytest/bats failures` | Tests fail on critical paths | Fix failing tests, run `make test` locally |

| Gate | Target Branch | Trigger | What it checks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Policy - PR Labeler | `main` | PR updated | Applies labels from `.github/labeler.yml` |
| Policy - Branch Policy Guard | `main` | PR targets `main` | Only `development` may merge to `main` |
| Policy - PR Guardrails | `main` | PR body | Checklist selections are required |
| Policy - ADR Policy | `main` | `adr-required` | ADR entry exists |
| Policy - Changelog Policy | `main` | `changelog-required` | Changelog entry exists |
| Metadata Validation | `main` | `md/yaml` files | Schema compliance and auto-heal |
| Quality - Pre-commit | **All** | Code changes | Lint/format/hook checks (MD034, MD026, EOF) |
| Quality - YAML/Markdown | **All** | YAML/MD files | Basic syntax linting |
| Quality - Doc Freshness | `main` | Living docs | Doc appears in index and is current |
| Plan - PR Terraform Plan | `main`* | Infra paths | Terraform fmt/validate/plan |
| **TDD Gate** | **All** | `.py`, `.sh` files | Corresponding test file exists |
| **Determinism Guard - Blast Radius** | **All** | >80 files changed | Requires `blast-radius-approved` label |
| **Determinism Guard - Tests** | **All** | Critical paths** | Runs pytest + bats tests |
| **Determinism Guard - Schemas** | **All** | `schemas/` changes | YAML schema validation |

*Note: Infrastructure plans are optional for `development` but recommended for validation.*

**Critical paths: modules/, scripts/, bootstrap/, .github/workflows/, envs/*.tf

## Conditional Bypass Labels (ADR-0101)

Certain labels can bypass PR guardrails if conditions are met:

| Label | Condition | Who Can Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs-only` | All changed files are `.md` | Anyone |
| `typo-fix` | < 50 lines changed, text files only | Anyone |
| `hotfix` | Target branch is `main` | Platform-team only |
| `build_id` | Terraform files changed | Platform-team only |

Labels are **validated, not trusted**. If the condition is not met, the check fails.

Implemented by: `scripts/pr_guardrails.py`

## Prevention Required Gate

PRs that fix bugs or errors MUST include:

1. The fix itself
2. A test, guard, or code change that prevents recurrence
3. Reference to root cause in commit message or PR description

**Exempt:** Pure feature additions, documentation-only changes.

**Rationale:** Hot fixes without prevention are technical debt. See
`docs/10-governance/07_AI_AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md` Section 10 for the full
Forward-Thinking Solutions Mandate.

| Acceptable | Not Acceptable |
| --- | --- |
| Fix + updated test that catches regression | Fix only, no prevention |
| Fix + script update that prevents recurrence | "Will fix properly later" |
| Fix + documentation of root cause + prevention | No root cause identified |
