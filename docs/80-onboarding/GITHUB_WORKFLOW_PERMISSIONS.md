# GitHub Workflow Permissions & Setup

## Context
By default, GitHub Actions workflows are restricted from creating Pull Requests or modifying the repository contents. This prevents the "Creation" workflows (e.g., `Create ECR Registry`, `Scaffold App`) from functioning correctly, as they rely on the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to open PRs for approval.

## Known Error
If this runbook is not followed, workflows will fail with:
```text
Error: GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.
```

## Solution: Enable PR Creation

A repository admin must perform the following one-time configuration:

1.  Navigate to the Repository on GitHub.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Actions** > **General**.
3.  Scroll down to the **Workflow permissions** section.
4.  Select **Read and write permissions**.
5.  **Critical**: Check the box **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**.
6.  Click **Save**.

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1.  Run the `Create ECR Registry` workflow manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
2.  Provide a test registry name (e.g., `test-permissions`).
3.  The workflow should successfully complete and output a link to a new Pull Request.

## Security Note
This setting grants the `GITHUB_TOKEN` elevated permissions. This is required for the "GitOps Self-Service" model where the robot proposes changes that a human must then approve and merge.
