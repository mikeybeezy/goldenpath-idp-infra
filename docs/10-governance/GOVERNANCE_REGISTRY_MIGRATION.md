# Log Files - Governance Registry Migration Assessment

**Date:** 2026-01-12  
**Type:** Supplemental Migration Analysis  

---

## Log-Related Artifacts Found

### ✅ **SHOULD MIGRATE** - Machine-Generated Logs

| Artifact | Location | Type | Generator | Migration Priority |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md** | `/docs/10-governance/reports/HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md` | Platform Health Snapshot | `platform_health.py` | 🟢 **HIGH** (Duplicate of PLATFORM_HEALTH.md) |
| **build-timings.csv** | `/docs/build-timings.csv` | Build Performance Data | `generate-build-log.sh`, `generate-teardown-log.sh` | 🟢 **HIGH** |

---

### 🟡 **HYBRID** - Partially Manual

| Artifact | Location | Type | Reason | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|------|--------|----------------|
| **BUILD_RUN_LOG.md** | `/docs/40-delivery/41_BUILD_RUN_LOG.md` | Build Run Summary | **Mixed:** References auto-generated CSV but contains manual annotations | ⚠️ **KEEP IN DEVELOPMENT** (Human context is valuable) |

---

### ❌ **DO NOT MIGRATE** - Hand-Maintained Documentation

| Artifact | Location | Type | Reason |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| **CHANGELOG_GOVERNANCE.md** | `/docs/90-doc-system/40_CHANGELOG_GOVERNANCE.md` | Policy Document | Hand-authored standards for changelog creation |
| **AI_CHANGELOG.md** | `/docs/90-doc-system/AI_CHANGELOG.md` | Agent Instructions | Curated guidance for AI-generated changelogs |
| **CHANGELOG_LABELS.md** | `/docs/changelog/CHANGELOG_LABELS.md` | Label Standards | Manual classification system |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
```markdown
# Platform Health Audit Log
Last updated: `2026-01-12 06:03:12`
- This file keeps only the latest snapshot.
- Full history can be regenerated from source data if needed.
```

**Problem:** This is a **duplicate** of `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md`. It's the exact same content, just stored in a different location.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MIGRATE & DEPRECATE**
- The governance registry already stores `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md` with a full history trail
- This file serves no additional purpose
- **Action:** Delete `HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md` from development and add a redirect:
  ```markdown
  # ⚠️ This file has been migrated
  
  Platform Health reports are now maintained in the Governance Registry:
  - **Latest:** [governance-registry/environments/development/latest/PLATFORM_HEALTH.md]
  - **History:** [governance-registry/environments/development/history/]
  ```

---

### 2. build-timings.csv ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current State:**
- Machine-generated by `generate-build-log.sh` and `generate-teardown-log.sh`
- Contains raw performance data (start time, end time, duration, exit codes)
- 40 rows of build/teardown timing data

**Why It Should Migrate:**
- ✅ **Machine-generated** (scripts write to it automatically)
- ✅ **Derived-only** (can be regenerated from workflow logs)
- ✅ **High update frequency** (every build/teardown run)
- ✅ **Observation domain** (records what happened, not what should happen)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MIGRATE**
- Move to: `governance-registry/environments/<env>/latest/build_timings.csv`
- Benefit: Every build/teardown creates a historical snapshot
- Example: `history/2026-01-12-1205Z-dc65243/build_timings.csv`

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# In governance-registry-writer.yml
- name: Copy build timings
  run: |
    if [ -f docs/build-timings.csv ]; then
      cp docs/build-timings.csv _govreg_out/build_timings.csv
    fi
```

---

### 3. BUILD_RUN_LOG.md 🟡 **HYBRID - KEEP IN DEVELOPMENT**

**Current State:**
- References `build-timings.csv` for raw data
- Contains **human annotations** and context:
  - "Notes: Clean Teardown, AWS orphans: TG = several..."
  - Manual observations about orphaned resources
  - Links to specific GitHub Actions runs

**Why It Should NOT Migrate:**
- ❌ **Partially manual** (humans add context and observations)
- ❌ **Intent domain** (documents learnings and strategic decisions)
- ⚠️ **Hand-curated summaries** (not reproducible from code alone)

**Recommendation:** **KEEP IN DEVELOPMENT**
- This is a "Living Log" with human intelligence
- The value is in the **annotations**, not the data itself
- **Action:** Update it to reference the governance registry for raw CSV data:
  ```markdown
  - **Raw Data:** [governance-registry/environments/development/latest/build_timings.csv]
  - **Historical Snapshots:** [governance-registry/environments/development/history/]
  ```

## Migration Impact Summary

### Files to Migrate to Governance Registry:

1. ✅ **HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md** → **DELETE** (duplicate of PLATFORM_HEALTH.md)
2. ✅ **build-timings.csv** → **MIGRATE** (pure machine-generated data)

### Files to Keep in Development:

1. ❌ **BUILD_RUN_LOG.md** (valuable human context)
2. ❌ **CHANGELOG_GOVERNANCE.md** (policy document)
3. ❌ **AI_CHANGELOG.md** (agent instructions)
4. ❌ **CHANGELOG_LABELS.md** (manual standards)

## Updated Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Duplicate Cleanup (Immediate)
- 🔲 Delete `HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md`
- 🔲 Add redirect placeholder pointing to governance registry

### Phase 2: Build Timings Migration (Week 1)
- 🔲 Update `generate-build-log.sh` to write to `_govreg_out/`
- 🔲 Update `generate-teardown-log.sh` to append to same file
- 🔲 Add `build_timings.csv` to registry writer workflow
- 🔲 Update `BUILD_RUN_LOG.md` to reference registry for raw data

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Forensic Analysis**
With `build-timings.csv` in the history trail:
- Compare build performance across commits
- Identify which code change degraded performance
- Track teardown efficiency over time

### 2. **No More Duplicate Files**
- `HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md` deletion removes redundancy
- Single source of truth for platform health

### 3. **Clean Development Branch**
- Only strategic logs (BUILD_RUN_LOG.md) with human context remain
- All raw machine data lives in the registry

---

**Recommendation:** ✅ Proceed with migrating `build-timings.csv` and deleting `HEALTH_AUDIT_LOG.md`.
