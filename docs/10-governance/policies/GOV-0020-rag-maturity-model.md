# GOV-0020: Agentic Graph RAG Maturity Model

## Purpose

This policy defines the maturity model for **Agentic Graph RAG** systems within the GoldenPath IDP. Unlike basic RAG implementations, this architecture integrates:

* **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)** - Entity relationships from Phase 0, not a later add-on
* **Agentic Capabilities** - Progression toward autonomous tool orchestration
* **Governance-Aware Automation** - Self-correcting agents with human approval workflows

The model establishes progression levels, requirements for advancement, governance controls, and the roadmap for achieving an autonomous, AI-native platform.

### Why "Agentic Graph RAG"?

| Component    | Role                                     | Without It                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph**    | Captures relationships between entities  | "What depends on GOV-0017?" is unanswerable       |
| **Agentic**  | Orchestrates tools, self-corrects        | Static Q&A only, no multi-step reasoning          |
| **RAG**      | Grounds responses in real documents      | Hallucination risk, no citations                  |

This is not RAG with optional enhancements—it's a unified architecture where graph traversal and agent orchestration are foundational, not aspirational.

---

## Core Principle

> **"Trust is earned through measured capability. Agents gain autonomy as they prove reliability."**

RAG systems progress through defined maturity levels. Each level unlocks new capabilities while maintaining governance guardrails. Advancement is gated on **measured outcomes**, not feature completion.

## Roadmap and Deliverables

### VQ Classification Key

Per [VQ_PRINCIPLES.MD](../../00-foundations/product/VQ_PRINCIPLES.MD) and [VQ_TAGGING_GUIDE.md](../../00-foundations/product/VQ_TAGGING_GUIDE.md):

| Class | Meaning | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 🔴 HV/HQ | High Value, High Quality | Trust-critical, do it right |
| 🟡 HV/LQ | High Value, Low Quality | Ship fast, reversible |
| 🔵 MV/HQ | Medium Value, High Quality | Do once, contain |
| ⚫ LV/LQ | Low Value, Low Quality | Drop it |

---

### Phase 0: Foundational RAG (L0)

**Target:** Prove basic retrieval value

| Deliverable | VQ Class | Impact | Savings/Query | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| RAG infrastructure setup | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Foundation | Services running locally |
| Document indexer | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | 0.5h | 100% GOV/ADR/PRD coverage |
| CLI query tool | 🟡 HV/LQ | tier-2 | 0.25h | Working CLI with citations |
| Phoenix observability | 🔵 MV/HQ | tier-2 | Debug time | Traces visible in UI |
| RAGAS baseline | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Quality gate | 20 test questions scored |

**Value Quantification:**

```yaml
phase_0_vq:
  total_potential_savings: 15h/week  # Based on 20 queries × 0.5h saved
  vq_class_distribution:
    HV_HQ: 3  # Infrastructure, indexer, RAGAS
    HV_LQ: 1  # CLI tool
    MV_HQ: 1  # Phoenix
  justification: |
    Every governance lookup currently takes 10-30 minutes of grep/search/read.
    RAG reduces this to <1 minute with citations. At 20+ queries/week,
    this reclaims ~15 hours of developer time weekly.
```

**Timeline:** 5 days

---

### Phase 1: Hybrid RAG (L1)

**Target:** Enable relationship-aware queries

| Deliverable | VQ Class | Impact | Savings/Query | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Knowledge graph integration | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | 1h | Entities extracted from docs |
| Hybrid retrieval | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Precision | Improved RAGAS scores |
| Metadata filtering | 🟡 HV/LQ | tier-2 | 0.1h | Filters working in CLI |
| FastAPI backend | 🟡 HV/LQ | tier-2 | Enables integrations | `/query` endpoint live |
| RAGAS CI integration | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Quality gate | Scores tracked per commit |

**Value Quantification:**

```yaml
phase_1_vq:
  total_potential_savings: 25h/week  # Multi-hop queries save more time
  vq_class_distribution:
    HV_HQ: 3  # Graph, hybrid, CI
    HV_LQ: 2  # Filtering, FastAPI
  justification: |
    Multi-hop queries ("What depends on GOV-0017?") currently require
    manual cross-referencing across 10+ docs. Graph traversal answers
    in seconds. Complex queries save 1h+ each.
```

**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Gate:** RAGAS context precision ≥ 0.75

---

### Phase 2: Corrective RAG (L2)

**Target:** Self-improving retrieval quality

| Deliverable | VQ Class | Impact | Savings/Query | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Confidence scoring | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Trust | Confidence scores in responses |
| Re-retrieval logic | 🔵 MV/HQ | tier-2 | 0.2h | 70% improvement rate |
| Uncertainty responses | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Prevents errors | False confidence < 5% |
| Reranking (optional) | ⚫ LV/LQ | tier-3 | Marginal | Precision improvement measured |

**Value Quantification:**

```yaml
phase_2_vq:
  total_potential_savings: 30h/week  # Higher confidence = fewer verification loops
  vq_class_distribution:
    HV_HQ: 2  # Confidence, uncertainty
    MV_HQ: 1  # Re-retrieval
    LV_LQ: 1  # Reranking (optional, defer if marginal)
  justification: |
    False confidence is expensive - acting on wrong info causes rework.
    Uncertainty flagging ("I'm not sure") prevents downstream errors.
    Saves 2-4h per prevented mistake.
```

**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Gate:** RAGAS precision ≥ 0.85, faithfulness ≥ 0.85

---

### Phase 3: Agentic RAG (L3)

**Target:** Multi-tool reasoning

| Deliverable | VQ Class | Impact | Savings/Query | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Tool definitions | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Foundation | 6+ tools defined |
| ReAct implementation | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | 2h | Agent handles multi-step |
| Tool orchestration | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Automation | 90% accuracy |
| Backstage integration | 🟡 HV/LQ | tier-2 | UX | Catalog data accessible |
| Agent evaluation | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Quality gate | 85% task completion |

**Value Quantification:**

```yaml
phase_3_vq:
  total_potential_savings: 50h/week  # Complex multi-step tasks automated
  vq_class_distribution:
    HV_HQ: 4  # Tools, ReAct, orchestration, eval
    HV_LQ: 1  # Backstage integration
  justification: |
    Multi-step queries ("Audit all modules for TDD compliance") currently
    require manual iteration across multiple tools. Agentic RAG completes
    these autonomously. Each complex query saves 2-4h.
```

**Timeline:** 4 weeks
**Gate:** Task completion ≥ 85%, tool accuracy ≥ 90%

---

### Phase 4: Autonomous IDP (L4)

**Target:** Governance-aware automation

| Deliverable | VQ Class | Impact | Savings/Query | Exit Criteria |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Compliance scanner | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | 4h/audit | Violations flagged |
| Change proposals | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | 1h/PR | PRs created successfully |
| Approval workflow | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Trust | Approval flow working |
| Backstage plugin | 🟡 HV/LQ | tier-2 | UX | Plugin deployed |
| Emergency stop | 🔴 HV/HQ | tier-1 | Safety | Stop mechanism tested |

**Value Quantification:**

```yaml
phase_4_vq:
  total_potential_savings: 80h/week  # Autonomous governance enforcement
  vq_class_distribution:
    HV_HQ: 4  # Scanner, proposals, approval, emergency stop
    HV_LQ: 1  # Backstage plugin
  justification: |
    Manual compliance audits take 4-8h each. Automated scanning runs
    continuously. Agent-proposed PRs save 1h each in scaffolding.
    At scale, autonomous governance reclaims significant engineering time.
```

**Timeline:** 8 weeks
**Gate:** Proposal acceptance ≥ 70%, false positive < 10%

---

### Cumulative Value Projection

| Phase | Weekly Savings | Cumulative | VQ Justification |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| L0 | 15h | 15h | Basic lookup automation |
| L1 | +10h | 25h | Multi-hop relationship queries |
| L2 | +5h | 30h | Reduced verification loops |
| L3 | +20h | 50h | Complex task automation |
| L4 | +30h | 80h | Autonomous governance |

> **Annual value at L4:** 80h/week × 50 weeks = **4,000 hours reclaimed**
