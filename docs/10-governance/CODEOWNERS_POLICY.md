# Policy: Code Ownership & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

**Status**: Active | **Owner**: Platform-Team | **Last Updated**: 2026-01-06

## Purpose
The Code Ownership policy ensures that every change to the repository is reviewed by subject matter experts. By leveraging the `CODEOWNERS` file, we enforce a strict **Defense in Depth** model where automation handles the "drudge work" while humans retain final authority over the "state of truth."

## Core Principles

### 1. The "Two-Person Rule" (Mandatory)
No code, configuration, or documentation index shall enter the `main` or `development` branches without at least two signatures:
- **Author**: The person (or bot) proposing the change.
- **Reviewer**: A human member of the authorized `CODEOWNERS` group.

### 2. Automation Oversight
Automation (Bots) are authorized to **draft** changes (e.g., auto-healing documentation, standardizing metadata), but they are **never** authorized to approve their own Pull Requests.

### 3. Subject Matter Accountability
Ownership is defined by directory and file type:
- **Infrastructure (`envs/`, `modules/`)**: Required review by Cloud/Platform Engineering.
- **Governance (`docs/10-governance/`, `docs/adrs/`)**: Required review by Platform Lead.
- **Automation (`scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`)**: Required review by Automation Specialists.

## Implementation: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
The `.github/CODEOWNERS` file is the technical enforcement of this policy. It is cryptographically linked to branch protection rules in GitHub, making it impossible to merge code without the required owner's signature.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Bot Tasks
For any task generated by a platform robot (e.g., `github-actions[bot]`):
1.  **Transparency**: The bot must commit with a clear prefix (e.g., `chore: auto-heal`).
2.  **Auditability**: The bot commit MUST be a separate commit within the PR to allow humans to diff it individually.
3.  **Human Anchor**: A human must review the bot's diff to ensure no unexpected or malicious side-effects were introduced during the automated generation.

## Compliance
Failure to adhere to this policy (e.g., bypassing review via admin rights) is a violation of the **Trusted Delivery Pipeline** standards and will trigger an immediate governance audit.
