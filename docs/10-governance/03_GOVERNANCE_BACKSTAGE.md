# Backstage Governance (Deprecated)

Doc contract:
- Purpose: Preserve the previous Backstage governance mapping for reference.
- Owner: platform
- Status: deprecated

- Related: docs/10-governance/01_GOVERNANCE.md, docs/00-foundations/18_BACKSTAGE_MVP.md, docs/adrs/ADR-0008-app-backstage-portal.md

Backstage governance guidance has been consolidated into
`docs/10-governance/01_GOVERNANCE.md` under **Backstage Governance Lens (Summary)** to avoid
