# Platform Health Dashboard Guide

The `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md` file at the repository root is the "Single Source of Truth" for the operational status, compliance, and governance reach of the GoldenPath IDP.

## Purpose & Usage

### 1. Operational Intelligence
The dashboard provides leadership and platform engineers with a high-level view of:
- **Metadata Compliance**: What percentage of our resources carry standardized governance data?
- **Lifecycle Distribution**: How many components are "Active" vs. "Draft" or "Deprecated"?
- **Risk Distribution**: What is our footprint of "High Impact" production resources?

### 2. Dark Infrastructure Detection
The **"Injection Coverage"** metric is specifically designed to identify "Dark Infrastructure." It cross-references our documentation (sidecars) with our deployment manifests (Helm/ArgoCD). If a component exists but is NOT advertising its ownership/risk as Kubernetes annotations, it is flagged as an **Injection Gap**.

### 3. Compliance Enforcement
Identify and remediate:
- **Orphaned Resources**: Components with no defined owner.
- **Stale Documents**: Information that has passed its `supported_until` date.

## How it is Updated

The dashboard is maintained by a fully automated "Closed-Loop" process:

| Trigger | Frequency | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Push** | Repository-wide | Re-generates report and commits it to `development`. |
| **Schedule** | Daily (Midnight) | Audits lifecycle staleness and commits updates. |
| **Manual** | On Demand | Can be triggered via [GitHub Actions](file:///Users/mikesablaze/goldenpath-idp-infra/.github/workflows/quality-platform-health.yaml). |

## Technical Implementation

- **Engine**: [`scripts/platform_health.py`](file:///Users/mikesablaze/goldenpath-idp-infra/scripts/platform_health.py)
- **Workflow**: [`.github/workflows/quality-platform-health.yaml`](file:///Users/mikesablaze/goldenpath-idp-infra/.github/workflows/quality-platform-health.yaml)
- **Automation**: Uses the `git-auto-commit-action` to ensure the dashboard state is persisted as a "stateful record" in Git.

## How to use this data
- **Audit Reports**: Use the "Injection Gaps" list as a task queue for governance remediation.
- **Backstage Integration**: The dashboard is a compliant Markdown file, allowing Backstage users to view "Platform Vitals" directly from the TechDocs portal.
- **Compliance Certification**: Use the **Metadata Compliance %** as a KPI for platform maturity.
