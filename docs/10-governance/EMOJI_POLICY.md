# Emoji Usage Policy

Emojis may be used sparingly and intentionally to improve readability, not to express tone or personality. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not decorate content.

## 1. Where emojis are allowed

Emojis are permitted only in human-facing, instructional documentation, such as:

- READMEs
- Onboarding guides
- Runbooks
- Operational checklists
- Troubleshooting sections

In these contexts, emojis act as semantic markers to help scanning and comprehension.

## 2. Where emojis are not allowed

Emojis must not be used in authoritative or contractual documents, including:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Governance documents
- Policies
- Contracts
- Schemas (`*.schema.yaml`)
- Metadata definitions
- Security documentation

These documents are long-lived, auditable, and must remain neutral and unambiguous.

## 3. Approved emoji set

Only the following emojis are approved for use:

- ⚠️ Warning / risk
- 🚫 Not allowed / unsupported
- ✅ Required / valid
- 🔒 Security-related note
- 🔴 HV/HQ - Protect at all costs
- 🟡 HV/LQ - Move fast, don't overthink
- 🔵 MV/HQ - Bound and freeze
- ⚫ LV/LQ - Actively resist

Expressive or celebratory emojis (e.g. 😁 😂 🔥 🙌 😲) are not permitted.

## 4. Usage rules

- **Semantic Reinforcement**: Emojis must reinforce meaning, not add tone.
- **Section-Level**: Use at most one emoji per section or callout.
- **Heading Placement**: Emojis should appear at the start of headings or callouts, not inline mid-sentence.
- **Preference for Text**: If meaning is clear without an emoji, prefer no emoji.
