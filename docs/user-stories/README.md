# User Stories (Living)

Purpose: tie platform features to the people they serve and the problem they
solve. Each story should link to the implementation evidence (ADR, changelog,
PR).

Use `US-0000-template.md` as the starting point.

Index: `docs/user-stories/00_INDEX.md`

## Rules

- Keep the story short and outcome-focused.
- Link to at least one ADR or changelog entry.
- Include acceptance criteria that a reviewer can verify.
