# ADR-0115: Enhanced Enum Validation Engine

## Context
ADR-0114 introduced the `validate_enums.py` script to enforce metadata consistency. However, the initial implementation relied on flat field matching, making it difficult to validate nested objects like `risk_profile.security_risk` or `reliability.observability_tier`.

## Decision
We will upgrade the `validate_enums.py` engine to use recursive dot-path traversal and a flexible mapping architecture.

### 1. Dot-Path Traversal
The script will implement a `get_dot(dict, "a.b.c")` utility to reach into nested YAML structures. This allows us to validate the platform's full schema without flattening the metadata files.

### 2. Flexible Mapping
Instead of hardcoding "if status check X", the script uses a `checks` mapping list:
- **Scope**: (file_kind, field_path, allowed_enum_list)
- **Extensibility**: New validation rules can be added by declaring a new mapping in the central list.

### 3. CI/CD Integration
The script is designed for "Changed Files Only" validation. By accepting positional file arguments, it can be seamlessly embedded into GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks to provide fast feedback during development.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Deep Validation**: Prevents drift in nested reliability and risk fields.
- **Improved Performance**: Allows CI to validate only what changed rather than scanning the entire repo.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized mapping logic makes the script easier to update as the metadata schema evolves.

### Negative
- **Validation Strictness**: Deep validation may reveal more legacy drift that requires remediation.
