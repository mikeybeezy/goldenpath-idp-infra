# ADR-0033: CI orchestrated modes for infra lifecycle

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-28
- **Owners:** Platform (GoldenPath IDP)
- **Domain:** Platform
- **Decision type:** Operations | Delivery
- **Related:** docs/20-contracts/21_CI_ENVIRONMENT_CONTRACT.md, .github/workflows/ci-bootstrap.yml

---

## Context

The infra lifecycle requires multiple phases (apply, bootstrap, teardown). When
operators must manually toggle flags, the workflow becomes brittle and error-prone.
We saw repeated failures caused by applying when we only needed bootstrap, or
reusing build IDs in the wrong phase.

We need a clear, enforceable model that reduces human error while keeping the
process flexible for V1.

## Decision

We will use **explicit CI modes** for the infra lifecycle:

1) **build + bootstrap** (default)
2) **bootstrap-only** (skip apply, reuse existing cluster/build)
3) **teardown**

Each mode enforces the correct phase ordering and input expectations.

## Scope

Applies to:

- CI bootstrap workflow
- Infra lifecycle runs in dev/test/staging/prod

Does not apply to:

- Ad-hoc local runs (allowed but not the default path)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces human error by encoding intent in workflow inputs.
- Prevents accidental apply when only bootstrap is needed.
- Makes infra runs more repeatable and auditable.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Adds workflow complexity (more inputs).
- Requires documentation so operators choose the right mode.

### Operational impact

- Operators must select the correct mode at dispatch time.
- Build ID reuse is allowed for bootstrap-only, not for apply.

## Alternatives considered

- **Single workflow with manual flags only:** rejected due to error-prone runs.
- **Separate workflows for each phase:** rejected to avoid fragmentation.

## Follow-ups

- Document mode behavior in the CI environment contract.
- Consider a single orchestrator workflow once CI stabilizes.

## Notes

Accepted for V1 with openness to refine mode enforcement as CI matures.
