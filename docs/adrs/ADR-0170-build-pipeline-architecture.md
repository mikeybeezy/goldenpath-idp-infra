# ADR-0170: Build Pipeline Architecture and Multi-Repo Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

GoldenPath IDP needs a standardized build pipeline that:

- Supports multiple application repositories
- Enforces security gates consistently
- Enables fast iteration in dev while maintaining prod safety
- Minimizes copy/paste drift across repos

The platform currently has:

- `goldenpath-idp-infra/` as the central infrastructure repo
- `hello-goldenpath-idp/` as a sample application repo
- argocd-image-updater configured for local environment with digest strategy

## Decision

### Architecture

Adopt a **canonical reusable workflow pattern**:

- **Platform repo** (`goldenpath-idp-infra/`) owns the canonical pipeline
- **App repos** call it via thin ~15-line caller workflows
- **GitOps** updates trigger ArgoCD sync

```
App Repo (intent/config)  --->  Canonical Pipeline (build/test/scan/push)  --->  GitOps update  --->  Argo sync
```

### Tagging Strategy

| Environment | Tag Format | Update Strategy | `:latest` Allowed |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| local | `:latest` | digest | Yes |
| dev | `:latest` | digest | Yes |
| test | `test-<sha>` | semver/tag | No |
| staging | `staging-<sha>` | semver/tag | No |
| prod | `prod-<sha>` | semver/tag | No |

### Authentication

**GitHub App** for git write-back (not deploy keys):

- Org-wide access
- Auto-rotating tokens (1-hour expiry)
- Rich audit trail
- One app covers all repos

Exception: Deploy key acceptable for local dev (single repo, ephemeral)

### Concurrency

- **Builds**: Parallel (no contention)
- **Deploys**: Serialized per environment via concurrency groups
- **Prod**: Serialized + approval gate

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: deploy-${{ inputs.environment }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

### Security Gates

| Gate | local/dev | test/staging/prod |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Trivy scan | Advisory | Blocking (HIGH/CRITICAL) |
| SARIF upload | Optional | Required |
| Gitleaks | Advisory | Blocking |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single source of truth for build logic
- No copy/paste drift across repos
- Consistent security enforcement
- Fast dev iteration preserved
- Audit trail via GitHub App

### Negative

- GitHub App setup overhead (~30 min one-time)
- Platform repo becomes critical path for pipeline changes
- Breaking change to canonical pipeline affects all repos

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking change affects all repos | Version the reusable workflow, test in dev first |
| GitHub App compromise | Store credentials in Secrets Manager, rotate on suspicion |
| Digest strategy confusion | Document clearly, train team on content-addressable images |

## Alternatives Considered

### Deploy Keys

- Pros: Simple, scoped to single repo
- Cons: Manual rotation, no audit trail, one key per repo
- Rejected: GitHub App better for multi-repo org

### Copy/Paste Workflows

- Pros: Teams have full control
- Cons: Drift, inconsistent security, maintenance burden
- Rejected: Reusable workflows prevent drift

### `:latest` Everywhere

- Pros: Simple
- Cons: No reproducibility, can't rollback reliably
- Rejected: `:latest` only for local/dev, immutable tags for higher envs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Create `_build-and-release.yml` canonical workflow
- Add Trivy blocking gates with SARIF upload
- Add concurrency groups
- Refactor `hello-goldenpath-idp` to thin caller

### Phase 2: Authentication & Promotion

- Create GitHub App
- Configure git write-back for dev/test/staging/prod
- Implement `<env>-<sha>` tagging
- Create promotion workflow

### Phase 3: Governance & Documentation

- Bootstrap prerequisites runbook
- App onboarding guide
- GitHub template repo for new apps

### Phase 4: V1.1 Enhancements (Deferred)

- SBOM generation (Syft)
- Image signing (Cosign)
- SLSA provenance
- Rollback playbook
