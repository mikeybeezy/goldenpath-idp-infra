## ADR immutability

ADRs are **immutable once created**. If a decision changes, write a new ADR and
mark the old one as **Superseded** with a reference to the new ADR.
Do not delete or rewrite prior ADRs.

## Context

We require a consistent release path that flows through the development branch
before reaching main. Recent changes temporarily relaxed the branch policy guard,
allowing non-development branches to merge directly into main. This increases
risk by bypassing the expected review and integration pathway.

## Decision

We will **restore the branch policy guard** so that only `development` may merge
into `main`.

## Scope

Applies to pull requests targeting `main`. Pull requests targeting other branches
remain unaffected.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enforces a single, predictable promotion path to main.
- Reduces the chance of bypassing required checks and review flow.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Hotfixes must be routed through development or explicitly handled via an
  approved override process.

### Operational impact

- Contributors must open PRs to `development` first, then promote to `main`.

## Alternatives considered

- Allowlist specific branches (rejected to keep policy simple and consistent).
- Disable the guard entirely (rejected due to release risk).

## Follow-ups

- Ensure documentation explains the development-to-main flow.

## Notes

This decision intentionally prioritizes consistency over ad-hoc merges.
