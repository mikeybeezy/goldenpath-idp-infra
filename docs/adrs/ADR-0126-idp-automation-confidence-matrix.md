# ADR-0126: IDP Automation Confidence Matrix

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the GoldenPath IDP moves at high velocity, the accumulation of "Dark History" (undocumented/untested scripts) and brittle automation poses a risk to platform stability. We need a rigorous, multi-dimensional framework to certify the maturity of our automation before it is promoted to core production usage.

## Decision

We officially adopt the **IDP Automation Confidence Matrix** as the standard for certifying all scripts and workflows. Approval is based on five "Surface Areas" of certification:

1.  **Logic Integrity**: Verified via unit tests, linting, and graceful error handling.
2.  **Operational Safety**: Verified via Idempotency and explicit Dry-Run support.
3.  **Governance Context**: Verified via ADR/CL traceability and VQ classification.
4.  **Interface Legibility**: Verified via `--help` documentation and clear logging.
5.  **System Integration**: Verified via CI/CD gating and multi-environment parity.

### Maturity Ratings
Scripts will be assigned a **Confidence Rating** (1-5 stars) based on these areas:
- **(1 Star)**: Lint-clean only.
- **(2 Stars)**: Documented and Owned.
- **(3 Stars)**: Tested and Safe (Idempotency + Dry-run).
- **(4 Stars)**: Field-Tested (Field verification record).
- **(5 Stars)**: Immutable Core (Full observability + Multi-env parity).

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Eliminates script brittleness and improves predictability.
- **Positive**: Provides a clear roadmap for maturing "experimental" scripts into "core" utilities.
- **Positive**: Improves operator confidence through transparent "Confidence Ratings" in the health dashboard.
- **Negative**: Adds overhead to the script promotion process (balanced by the VQ of self-healing automation).
