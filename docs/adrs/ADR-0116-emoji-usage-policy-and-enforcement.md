## ADR-0116: Emoji Usage Policy & Automated Enforcement

## Context

Documentation quality and professional neutrality are core tenets of the platform. Excessive or semi-random emoji usage in authoritative documents (ADRs, Policies, Schemas) can obscure meaning and reduce the professional tone of the repository.

## Decision

We will establish a formal [Emoji Usage Policy](doc/governance/EMOJI_POLICY.md) and implement automated enforcement.

### 1. The Policy

- **Authoritative Documents**: Emojis are strictly prohibited in ADRs, Policies, Contracts, Schemas, and Metadata definitions.
- **Instructional Documents**: Emojis are permitted only for semantic marking (e.g., , , ) to highlight critical information.

### 2. Automated Enforcement

We will use `scripts/enforce_emoji_policy.py` as a Quality Gate:

- **Local Hook**: Integrated into `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to prevent invalid emojis from being committed.
- **CI/CD Gate**: Integrated into `ci-metadata-validation.yml` to block non-compliant PRs.
- **Auto-Healing**: The CI pipeline will automatically strip forbidden emojis from changelogs and documentation when violations are detected.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Professionalism**: Ensures a consistent, unambiguous tone across the Knowledge Graph.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Semantic emojis highlight important notes without visual clutter.
- **High Integrity**: Automated enforcement prevents policy bypass.

### Negative

- **Strictness**: Developers may occasionally have their commits blocked or auto-healed if they include unapproved emojis.
