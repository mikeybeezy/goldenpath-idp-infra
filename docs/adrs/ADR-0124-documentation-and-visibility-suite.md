# ADR-0124: Documentation & Visibility Suite

## Status

Accepted (Backfill)

## Context

Maintaining a large documentation-as-code repository requires automated validation of freshness, structure, and relationships. These tools were built to prevent "Doc Drift" and ensure the Knowledge Graph remains accurate.

## Decision

We officially adopt the following scripts as the core Documentation & Visibility Suite:

1.  **`format_docs.py`**: Ensures consistent whitespace and layout across the markdown corpus.
2.  **`check_doc_freshness.py`**: Identifies stale documents based on metadata and commit history.
3.  **`check_doc_index_contract.py`**: Enforces the "Index Policy" (every directory must have an index).
4.  **`extract_relationships.py`**: Populates the Knowledge Graph by parsing `relates_to` and `supersedes` metadata.
5.  **`generate_governance_vocab.py`**: Generates the human-readable [GOVERNANCE_VOCABULARY.md](../../governance/GOVERNANCE_VOCABULARY.md).
6.  **`sync_backstage_entities.py`**: Mirrors internal metadata to Backstage YAML entities.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: High documentation quality and navigability.
- **Positive**: Automated alignment between the repo and the Backstage Catalog.
- **Negative**: Adds overhead to CI runs (mitigated by only running on doc changes).
