# ADR-0068: Fix review cadence output delimiter

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-01-02
- **Owners:** platform
- **Domain:** Platform
- **Decision type:** Operations
- **Related:** `.github/workflows/production-readiness-review.yml`, PR #108

## ADR immutability

ADRs are **immutable once created**. If a decision changes, write a new ADR and
mark the old one as **Superseded** with a reference to the new ADR.
Do not delete or rewrite prior ADRs.

---

## Context

The production readiness review cadence workflow writes multi-line output to
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`. The current quoted heredoc delimiter breaks note parsing and
causes the check to fail even when the script runs correctly.

## Decision

We will **use an unquoted heredoc delimiter** when writing `GITHUB_OUTPUT` in the
review cadence workflow.

## Scope

Applies to the output handling in `production-readiness-review.yml` only.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Review cadence checks succeed when the script output is valid.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- None.

### Operational impact

- None.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep the current delimiter and accept intermittent failures (rejected).

## Follow-ups

- None.

## Notes

This restores expected GitHub Actions output handling.
