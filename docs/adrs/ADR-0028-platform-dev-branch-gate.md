# ADR-0028: Dev branch gate before main

## Context

We want quality gates that prove changes run in a real environment before they
reach `main`. Relying solely on plans or post-merge applies weakens the value of
the dev environment as a gate. A simple branch strategy can enforce a practical
pre-merge apply without introducing per-PR ephemeral environments.

## Decision

Introduce a **dev branch gate**:

- Feature branches merge into `dev`.
- `dev` applies to the shared dev environment.
- Only changes that pass in `dev` are promoted to `main`.

This keeps the dev environment as a shared gate while avoiding per-PR
environment cost.

## Scope

Applies to platform infrastructure and platform workloads. It defines the
minimum promotion path for changes that affect delivery rails or infrastructure.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Real apply happens before `main` changes.
- Clear promotion path with a shared dev gate.
- Lower cost than per-PR ephemeral environments.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Shared dev can become a bottleneck if multiple changes converge.
- Failures on `dev` block promotion to `main`.

### Operational impact

- `dev` becomes the pre-merge validation branch.
- Promotion requires a clean dev run before merging to `main`.

## Alternatives considered

- **PR-scoped dev environments:** better isolation but higher cost/complexity.
- **Plan-only gates:** cheaper but weaker quality signal.

## Follow-ups

- Update branch protection to require dev checks before `main`.
- Document the dev gate workflow in governance and onboarding.

## Notes

This decision balances quality gates with cost and operational simplicity.
