# ADR-0183: Test Health Metrics Schema Contract

Filename: `ADR-0183-test-health-metrics-schema.md`

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-01-26

## ADR immutability

ADRs are **immutable once created**. If a decision changes, write a new ADR and
mark the old one as **Superseded** with a reference to the new ADR.

---

## Context

Test results and coverage are emitted by multiple frameworks across multiple
repos. Without a stable contract, dashboards can drift, silently drop fields,
or report false-green states. A schema contract is required to keep test health
metrics deterministic, auditable, and compatible across repos.

---

## Decision

We will define and enforce a **Test Health Metrics Schema Contract** for all
test/coverage outputs used by `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md` and the Test Health dashboard.

---

## Scope

**Applies to**
- Test metrics payloads produced by `goldenpath-idp-infra` and
  `goldenpath-idp-backstage`.
- Governance-registry artifacts used to render `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md`.

**Does not apply to**
- Raw framework outputs (JUnit, coverage XML/JSON) before normalization.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- Prevents false-green dashboards caused by missing or malformed fields.
- Ensures deterministic, cross-repo compatibility.
- Enables validation gates and auditability.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Adds a small maintenance cost for schema changes.
- Requires coordination when new fields are introduced.

### Operational impact

- CI pipelines must emit schema-compliant payloads.
- Validation failures must be addressed before reporting.

---

## Alternatives considered

1) **No schema**: rejected due to drift and false-green risk.
2) **Ad-hoc per repo**: rejected due to fragmentation and lack of comparability.

---

## Follow-ups

- Implement schema validation for the normalized payload.
- Update CI to emit schema-compliant test health metrics.
- Integrate validated metrics into `PLATFORM_HEALTH.md`.

---

## Notes

If the schema must change, create a new ADR and version the payload to avoid
breaking consumers.
