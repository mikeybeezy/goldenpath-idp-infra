# ADR-0080: GitHub App Roles for AI/Automation Access

Date: 2026-01-03
Status: Proposed
Owners: platform

## Context

We need a way to grant AI and automation roles without creating new human
GitHub accounts. The solution must be auditable, least-privilege, and easy to
rotate.

## Decision

Adopt GitHub Apps as the default mechanism for AI/automation access, with
minimal permissions scoped to specific repositories.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Fine-grained permissions and auditability.
- Tokens are short-lived and easier to rotate.
- No human accounts required.

**Negative**

- Requires App setup and lifecycle management.
- Additional documentation and onboarding steps.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Service accounts (bot users)**
   - Rejected: requires additional user accounts and broader permissions.
2. **Personal access tokens**
   - Rejected: long-lived secrets, higher risk and poorer auditability.
