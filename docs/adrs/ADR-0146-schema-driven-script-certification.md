context:
  - Scripts are a critical part of the platform control plane.
  - Currently, script quality is enforced heuristically (e.g., check if a test file
    exists), which is brittle and unverifiable.
  - We lack a mechanism to verify that a script supports safety features like Dry-Run
    without executing it.
  - There is no machine-readable link between a script, its test runner, and its execution
    proof in CI.
decision:
  - We will adopt a **Schema-Driven Certification** model for all platform automation
    scripts.
  - Every script MUST contain a structured YAML metadata block (Frontmatter) in its
    header.
  - This metadata MUST conform to `schemas/automation/script.schema.yaml`.
  - The schema defines strict contracts for Identity, Maturity, Dry-Run Support, and
    Testing Strategy.
  - We will enforce this contract using a dedicated validator (`validate_scripts_tested.py`)
    in CI.
consequences:
  - Scripts become self-describing assets with explicit safety profiles.
  - CI can deterministically verify if a specific script is tested, purely by reading
    its contract.
  - Enables advanced policy enforcement (e.g., 'High Impact scripts must use CI proofs').
  - 'Migration cost: Existing scripts must be updated with metadata headers.'
alternatives:
  - 'Continue with file-existence heuristics (Rejected: Too fragile, no dry-run verification).'
  - 'Maintain a central `tests.json` registry (Rejected: High drift risk; metadata
    should live with the code).'
compliance:
  - All scripts in `scripts/` MUST have a `script` type validation block.
  - 'High-risk scripts MUST declare `evidence: ci` and generate proof artifacts.'

# ADR-0146: Schema-Driven Script Certification

## Context
The platform currently relies on dozens of Python and Bash scripts to manage critical lifecycle events (metadata standardization, registry mirroring, secret management). While we have a high-level "Confidence Matrix" (ADR-0126), the actual enforcement of this matrix has been manual or heuristic.

There was no way for a machine to look at `scripts/remediate_everything.py` and answer:
1. Is this safe to run? (Dry-run support)
2. How do I test it? (Runner command)
3. Is it production ready? (Maturity level)

## Decision

We are shifting governance **left**, directly into the source code headers.

### 1. The Contract (`script.schema.yaml`)
We define a rigid schema that every script must satisfy. Key fields:

```yaml
test:
  runner: pytest
  command: "pytest tests/unit/test_my_script.py"
  evidence: ci
dry_run:
  supported: true
risk_profile:
  production_impact: high
```

### 2. Implementation Pattern
Metadata is embedded in the native comment format of the language:

**Python:**
```python
"""
---
id: my_script
type: script
...
---
"""
```

**Bash:**
```bash
# ---
# id: my_script
# type: script
# ...
# ---
```

### 3. Verification
A new tool, `scripts/validate_scripts_tested.py`, acts as the **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**. It runs in CI/Pre-commit and blocks any script that:
1. Lacks a header.
2. Violates the schema.
3. Claims `evidence: ci` but has no corresponding Test Proof artifact.

## Consequences

### Positive
*   **Transparency:** Developers see the quality contract immediately when opening a file.
*   **Automation:** CI can intelligently selectively test scripts based on their metadata.
*   **Safety:** The `dry_run.supported` flag allows us to build generic "Safe Runners" that can execute any script in preview mode blindly.

### Negative
*   **Boilerplate:** Minimal overhead added to every script file (~15 lines).
*   **Migration:** We need to backfill headers for ~40 existing scripts.

## Compliance
This ADR supersedes heuristic checks. The "Script Certification Audit" document (`SCRIPT_CERTIFICATION_AUDIT.md`) will track the migration progress towards 100% compliance.

Implementing tools:
*   `generate_script_matrix.py`: Automated certification reporting.
*   `scaffold_test.py`: Standardized test scaffolding for certification.
*   `check-policy-compliance.py`: Automated policy governance.
