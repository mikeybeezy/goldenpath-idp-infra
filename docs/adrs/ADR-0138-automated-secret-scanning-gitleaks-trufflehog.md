# ADR-0138: Automated Secret Scanning with Gitleaks and TruffleHog

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-01-10
- **Owners:** `platform-team`
- **Domain:** Security
- **Decision type:** Security | Operations

---

## Context

As we transition to using **AWS Secrets Manager** and **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** for credential management, we must ensure that secrets do not bypass these governed systems and leak into the Git repository in plain text. Plain-text secrets in Git are a "Point of No Return" security event requiring complete rotation and history scrubbing.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered automated secret scanning strategy using **Gitleaks** and **TruffleHog**.

### 1. Shift-Left Protection (Local Pre-Commit)
- **Tool**: Gitleaks (CLI)
- **Integration**: Added to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- **Action**: Prevent a commit if a secret pattern is detected. This ensures secrets never reach the `.git` directory on origin.

### 2. CI/CD Gatekeeping (GitHub Actions)
- **Tool**: Gitleaks + TruffleHog OSS
- **Integration**: Added to Pull Request workflows.
- **Action**:
    - **Gitleaks**: Scans the entire commit history of the PR for patterns.
    - **TruffleHog**: Scans and **verifies** identified secrets (AWS, GitHub, etc.) to confirm if the secret is active.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Drift Prevention**: Forces developers to use the governed `aws_secrets_manager` module.
- **Reduced False Positives**: TruffleHog's verification engine ensures only actionable leaks break the build.
- **Auditability**: Every PR is programmatically audited for security compliance.

### Tradeoffs / Risks
- **Build Latency**: Scanning large codebases can add 30-60 seconds to CI runs.
- **Maintenance**: Rule sets must be updated periodically to catch new secret formats.

## Operational impact

- Developers must have Gitleaks installed locally or run via `pre-commit`.
- Security incidents (detected leaks) must trigger an immediate rotation of the leaked credential, even if the commit is blocked.

## Alternatives considered

### GitHub Secret Scanning (Native)
- **Pros**: Zero configuration, native to GitHub.
- **Cons**: Only scans after push; doesn't provide local pre-commit prevention for custom/proprietary secret formats.

### Snyk / Checkov
- **Status**: Already in use for general linting/vulnerability scanning, but Gitleaks/TruffleHog provide deeper, specialized secret verification.

## Follow-ups
- Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Gitleaks hook.
- Create `.github/workflows/ci-secret-scan.yml`.
