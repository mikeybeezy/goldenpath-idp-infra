# ADR-8889: Long Context Test

## Context
This is a very long paragraph that should definitely be truncated by the generate_adr_index script because it exceeds the 200 character limit that we have established for the table summary column so that the markdown table remains readable and doesn't stretch too wide in the browser or terminal or whatever tool the user is using to view this documentation index. It keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going.

## Decision
Testing truncation.
