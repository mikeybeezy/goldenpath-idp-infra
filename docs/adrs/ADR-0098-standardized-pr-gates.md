## ADR-0098: Standardized PR Gates for ECR Pipeline

## Context

The ECR pipeline PRs were experiencing repeated CI failures due to inconsistent guardrail checks, YAML linting errors, and missing metadata. Multiple workflows needed to trigger on both `main` and `development` branches, and the PR template required explicit checklist selections.

## Decision

We introduce a unified set of PR gate workflows that enforce:

- Mandatory checklist selections in the PR body.
- Consistent `pull_request` triggers for all relevant CI jobs.
- Centralized YAML linting and pre‑commit formatting.
- Automated metadata validation.

All future PRs targeting `development` or `main` must pass these gates before merge.

## Consequences

### Positive

- CI checks become deterministic and pass reliably.
- Reduced manual re‑work for reviewers.
- Clear governance for ECR‑related changes.

### Trade‑offs / Risks

- Slight increase in CI runtime due to additional linting steps.
- Contributors must keep the PR template up‑to‑date.

### Operational Impact

- Documentation updated (this ADR, changelog entry).
- Existing PRs may need to be rebased to satisfy new checks.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep existing ad‑hoc guardrails – rejected due to high failure rate.
- Disable linting – rejected because code quality would degrade.

## Follow‑ups

- Update the PR template to include the required checkboxes.
- Communicate the new process to all engineering teams.
