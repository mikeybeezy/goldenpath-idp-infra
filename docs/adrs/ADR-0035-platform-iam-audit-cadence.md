# ADR-0035: IAM Audit Cadence for CI Roles

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-28
- **Owners:** Platform (GoldenPath IDP)
- **Decision type:** Security / Governance
- **Related:** docs/10-governance/01_GOVERNANCE.md, docs/60-security/33_IAM_ROLES_AND_POLICIES.md

## Context

CI roles are intentionally broad during early iterations to keep the platform
moving. Over time, unused permissions should be removed to reduce risk and
increase confidence in least-privilege access. Today, we do not have a defined
cadence or trigger for auditing these roles.

We need a lightweight, repeatable process that:

- identifies unused permissions
- avoids slowing delivery
- allows tightening once the platform is stable

## Decision

GoldenPath will institute a periodic IAM audit for CI roles (and key platform
roles) using CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer.

The audit will be triggered:

- after a stability milestone (e.g., successful multi-env CI runs), or
- on a periodic cadence (e.g., quarterly)

The outcome of each audit is a documented change set to remove unused actions
from CI roles, with changes captured in PRs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces excess permissions based on real usage.
- Creates a habit of least-privilege maintenance.
- Aligns security posture with platform maturity.

### Tradeoffs

- Requires periodic time from the platform team.
- Some permissions may need to be re-added if future needs change.

## Alternatives Considered

- **No audits:** rejected due to growing security risk over time.
- **Continuous hard gates:** rejected for V1 because it would slow iteration.

## Follow-ups

- Add an IAM audit runbook (CloudTrail filter + Access Analyzer review steps).
- Create a checklist for tightening CI role policies.
