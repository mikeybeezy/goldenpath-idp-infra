## Context

New docs are often created without the required metadata headers. The missing
frontmatter is usually only discovered at PR time, which creates friction and
burns review cycles. We need a path that makes compliant headers the default,
not an afterthought.

## Decision

We will enforce a three-layer flow for new documentation:

1. **Scaffold** new docs via `scripts/scaffold_doc.py` so headers match the
   metadata schema from day one.
2. **Auto-fix** doc headers in pre-commit using `scripts/standardize_metadata.py`
   for any changed Markdown file under `docs/`.
3. **Validate** in CI with `scripts/validate_metadata.py` as a backstop only.

## Scope

### Applies to

- Markdown docs under `docs/`.

### Does not apply to

- Generated reports or config files (use sidecar metadata).
- Non-doc source code.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Authors get compliant headers automatically.
- PRs fail less often on missing metadata.
- Governance remains enforced without slowing delivery.

### Tradeoffs / Risks

- Pre-commit will modify files, requiring a re-stage.
- Authors must use the scaffold for best results.

### Operational impact

- Add `scripts/scaffold_doc.py`.
- Add a pre-commit hook for doc header normalization.

## Alternatives considered

### CI-only validation

Rejected because it shifts enforcement to the end of the workflow and causes
avoidable rework.

### Manual templates only

Rejected because manual copying still leads to inconsistent metadata.

## Follow-ups

- Update onboarding docs to reference the scaffold script.
- Monitor pre-commit friction and adjust scope if needed.
