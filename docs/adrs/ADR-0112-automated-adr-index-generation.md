## ADR-0112: Automated ADR Index Generation

## Context

As the number of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) grows (currently 100+), keeping the `01_adr_index.md` in sync manually has become error-prone. We frequently observe drift in statuses, dates, and related links. While we have a standardized metadata schema, the index remains a manual "View" that requires constant reconciliation.

## Decision

We will automate the generation of the ADR Index from the source files' metadata.

### Iteration 1: Git-Native Automation

We will implement a `scripts/generate_adr_index.py` tool that:

1. Parses YAML frontmatter from all ADR files.
2. Regenerates the Markdown table and metadata associations.
3. Is enforced by the `ci-index-auto-heal.yml` workflow.

### Transition Plan (Iteration 2)

This Git-native solution is an interim measure to ensure immediate consistency. As the IDP matures, we will transition the ADR lifecycle into **Backstage**. In that phase, the physical index file may be replaced or augmented by a dynamic portal view powered by the Knowledge Graph.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single Source of Truth**: The ADR file itself owns its metadata.
- **Zero Drift**: Automation ensures the index always reflects the physical reality.
- **Improved Discoverability**: Context snippets in the index are always up-to-date.

### Negative

- **Build Dependency**: Modifying an ADR metadata field now requires a script run to update the index (handled by auto-healing).

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Maintenance**: Rejected due to high overhead and persistent drift.
- **Direct-to-Backstage**: Deferred; requires further portal configuration and Knowledge Graph maturity.
