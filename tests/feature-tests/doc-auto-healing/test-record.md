# Feature Test Record: Documentation Auto-Healing (HITL)

**Test Date**: 2026-01-06
**Status**: ✅ PASSED
**PR Reference**: [PR #172](https://github.com/mikeybeezy/goldenpath-idp-infra/pull/172)
**Tester**: Platform Team (Human-in-the-Loop)

## 📋 Scenario
Verify that the `Quality - Documentation Auto-Healing` workflow correctly detects documentation drift and performs automated corrections that require human approval before merging.

### 🧪 Test Components
1.  **Script Auto-Heal**: Added `scripts/shadow_script.py` without updating `scripts/index.md`.
2.  **Workflow Auto-Heal**: Added `.github/workflows/shadow-workflow.yml` without updating `ci-workflows/CI_WORKFLOWS.md`.

## 🚀 Execution & Results

### Phase 1: Script Drift Detection
- **Action**: Pushed `scripts/shadow_script.py` to `test/auto-heal-hitl-verification`.
- **Observation**: The CI workflow detected drift in `scripts/index.md` (Exit Code 1).
- **Correction**: The `github-actions[bot]` automatically pushed a fix adding the script to the index.
- **Verification**: Index updated correctly with docstring metadata.

### Phase 2: Workflow Drift Detection
- **Action**: Pushed `.github/workflows/shadow-workflow.yml`.
- **Observation**: The CI workflow detected drift in `ci-workflows/CI_WORKFLOWS.md`.
- **Correction**: The `github-actions[bot]` automatically pushed a second fix adding the workflow to the index.
- **Verification**: Workflow index correctly categorized the new test workflow.

### Phase 3: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- **Role Play**: User reviewed both bot-generated commits.
- **Enforcement**: PR remained blocked by `CODEOWNERS` until human approval was granted.
- **Finality**: PR was manually merged, completing the trust cycle.

## 🛡️ Security Observations
- **Least Privilege**: The bot only modified the two targeted index files.
- **Safe Parsing**: Scripts successfully extracted metadata from new files without execution.
- **No Loops**: `[skip ci]` tags prevented recursive workflow triggers.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The Documentation Auto-Healing system is fully functional and adheres to the **Defense in Depth** governance model. No further manual indexing is required for standard script or workflow additions.
