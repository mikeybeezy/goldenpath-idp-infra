The Kubernetes provider service accounts use deprecated kubernetes_service_account; fractor to adopt kubernetes_service_account_v1.


Destroy/recreate workflows should include explicit steps for unmanaged resources (node groups, load balancers, EKS add‑ons). = provide suggestions


basd on the below. provide feedback 

If Kong is your ingress/API gateway (recommended default)

Use an NLB in front of Kong.

Why:

NLB is simple, fast, and stable for exposing a single entrypoint (Kong)

Works well for TCP + HTTP(S), gRPC, WebSockets

You let Kong own L7 routing/policies (auth, rate limits, routes), not AWS

Typical pattern: Service type=LoadBalancer for Kong → NLB → Kong routes to services.

If you want AWS-native L7 ingress (without Kong doing the L7 heavy lifting)

Use an ALB.

Why:

Best for HTTP/HTTPS host/path routing at the AWS edge

Easy integration with AWS WAF, redirects, listener rules, OIDC auth (AWS-native)

Clean “Ingress resource → ALB” flow

Quick decision rule

Kong as the single front door → NLB

AWS-managed L7 routing/WAF as the front door → ALB

Don’t run both by default in V1 unless you have a specific reason (it creates ambiguity/support load)

 kubectl -n kube-system scale deployment/efs-csi-controller --replicas=1

 efs-csi-controller

we need to set their default replicas to 1 for now becaause they are consumng too many resources

I've now moved  all things relating to bootstraping to this directory /Users/mikesablaze/Documents/relaunch/goldenpath-idp-infra/bootstrap/0.5_BOOTSTRAP
scan the directory files and ensure corhearance with contnet

I have moved all the  boostrap related read me to one file /Users/mikesablaze/Documents/relaunch/goldenpath-idp-infra/bootstrap/0.5_BOOTSTRAP/README.md
ensure that the content flows well and it is up to day and accurate. Make sure that all retition is removed. ensure that it can be read by a college student

review and propose any refinement. let me know the changes yoi plan to make befor youb make them
